== Description ==

![How GDU Works](https://raw.github.com/aubreypwd/google-destination-url/master/screenshot-1.gif)

This plugins saves you from having to open another tab, perform a 
Google Search, copy the link, close the tab, and paste (whew~). 

All you have to do is click Add Link, do a quick Google Search, click 
the link you want to add. BAM!
