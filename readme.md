Perform a Google Search when adding a link in the editor.

This plugins saves you from having to open another tab, perform a 
Google Search, copy the link, close the tab, and paste (whew~). 

All you have to do is click Add Link, do a quick Google Search, click 
the link you want to add. BAM!

# Filters

Most functions have a filter with the same name, and modifying variables 
usually uses `function_name_$var` to modify.

If you want to incorporate other results, you can easily, for instance,
filter `gdurl_googapi` and add more results, etc.
